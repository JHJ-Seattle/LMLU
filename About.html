  <main class="about-content">
    <p>Eighteen years ago, a children‚Äôs art teacher, and mother of a child with Down syndrome, had a simple yet powerful dream:
      to share the joy and healing power of art with children who have special needs. She believed that art could enrich lives,
      spark imagination, and build confidence. That dream became a reality in 2017 with the founding of Love Me. Love Us. What
      began as a small art class has since grown into a vibrant nonprofit offering programs in music, sports, and academic tutoring.</p>
    <p>To date, Love Me. Love Us. has touched the lives of over 100 families with developmental disabilities and partnered with
      more than 200 dedicated high school volunteers. We've hosted over 100 events focused on inclusion, growth, and connection.
      We don‚Äôt just serve families with special needs‚Äîwe are families with special needs. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre called "Love Me. Love Us."
      With love as our foundation, we believe in building a community where lives are enriched, spirits are uplifted,
      and every individual‚Äôs potential is empowered.</p>
